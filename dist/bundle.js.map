For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t   *\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n\t   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n\t   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n\t   *\n\t   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n\t   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n\t   *     }\n\t   *\n\t   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   */\n\t  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n\t    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n\t      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n\t      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t        return true;\n\t      }\n\t      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    return false;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n\t    if (a === b) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (\n\t      !isIterable(b) ||\n\t      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n\t      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n\t      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n\t      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n\t      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n\t    ) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\t\n\t    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n\t      var entries = a.entries();\n\t      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n\t        var entry = entries.next().value;\n\t        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n\t      }) && entries.next().done;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var flipped = false;\n\t\n\t    if (a.size === undefined) {\n\t      if (b.size === undefined) {\n\t        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n\t          a.cacheResult();\n\t        }\n\t      } else {\n\t        flipped = true;\n\t        var _ = a;\n\t        a = b;\n\t        b = _;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var allEqual = true;\n\t    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n\t      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n\t          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n\t        allEqual = false;\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\t\n\t    function Repeat(value, times) {\n\t      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n\t        return new Repeat(value, times);\n\t      }\n\t      this._value = value;\n\t      this.size = times === undefined ?

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?
